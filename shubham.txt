If you're trying to set up Django on a new laptop, here’s a step-by-step guide to get started:

---

### **1. Install Python**
Ensure Python is installed on your laptop. Django requires Python 3.8 or later.  
- **Check if Python is installed**:  
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```
  or  
  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```

- **If Python is not installed**:  
  - Download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

---

### **2. Install `pip` (Python package manager)**
- `pip` is usually installed with Python. Confirm by running:  
  ```bash
  pip --version
  ```

- If `pip` is not installed, you can install it by downloading [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and running:  
  ```bash
  python get-pip.py
  ```

---

### **3. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
A virtual environment isolates your Django project’s dependencies.  

- Create a virtual environment:  
  ```bash
  python -m venv myenv
  ```

- Activate the virtual environment:  
  - On **Windows**:  
    ```bash
    myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - On **Mac/Linux**:  
    ```bash
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

---

### **4. Install Django**
With `pip`, install Django in your virtual environment or globally:  
```bash
pip install django
```

- Verify the installation:  
  ```bash
  django-admin --version
  ```

---

### **5. Create a New Django Project**
To start a new Django project, run:  
```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
```

- Navigate to the project folder:  
  ```bash
  cd myproject
  ```

---

### **6. Run the Development Server**
Start the built-in server to check if everything works:  
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

- Open a browser and go to:  
  [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

You should see the Django welcome page.

---

### **7. (Optional) Install Additional Tools**
- **Database:** If you're using a database like PostgreSQL, install the required libraries:  
  ```bash
  pip install psycopg2
  ```

- **Frontend tools:** Install tools like `django-bootstrap5` for frontend development if needed.
